The tournament offers the Lions a potential third chance to face off against the Princeton Tigers—to claim Columbia’s first women’s basketball Ancient Eight title."

The second seed Columbia Lions (21-5, 12-2 Ivy) will match up against the third seed Yale Bulldogs (16-10, 9-5 Ivy), and the first seed Princeton Tigers (22-4, 14-0 Ivy) will match up against the fourth seed Harvard Crimson (13-13, 7-7 Ivy). Harvard is tied with Penn (12-14, 7-7 Ivy) in both their Ivy record and their matchup, but Harvard’s victory against the Bulldogs on February 5 secured a tiebreak advantage against Penn, who lost both games against Yale."

With these crucial wins, the Bulldogs were able to claim a third seed, even with inferior ratings to Penn, who will not be competing in the tournament."

Over the course of the conference season, the Light Blue have outpaced the Elis both offensively and defensively. The Lions have done a good job locking up the Bulldogs’ leading scorers Camille Emsbo and Clark in the regular season, and they will seek to continue this defensive effort in their third meeting."

Harvard is a volume three-point shooting team averaging 8.9 threes made per game in Ivy Play, leading the conference. Its offensive execution is also top-notch, averaging just 12 turnovers per game, with an assist-turnover ratio of 1.26, ranking second in both, behind Princeton."

Besides the two games against Columbia, in which the Princeton starters all played over 30 minutes, Princeton usually goes deep into its bench. Kaitlyn Chen, who averages just 29.6 minutes in conference play, plays the most minutes for the Tigers while star sophomore guard Abbey Hsu leads the Lions with 32.7, and Yale guard Jenna Clark averages 36.8. Thus, when Princeton lets its core stars, guards Abby Meyers and Julia Cunningham, play a full slate of minutes in the tournament, the squad could ascend to more impressive heights."

The best scorer in the tournament is Princeton’s Abby Meyers, who averages 17.6, and Harvard’s Turner Harmoni, who is a rookie, follows close behind with 16.9. Hsu has struggled sometimes during conference play, but she found her touch in the final two games, scoring 18 and 25 respectively. If she could continue this good form, she can be the best scorer in the postseason, as she is ranked third in scoring in the overall season so far."
